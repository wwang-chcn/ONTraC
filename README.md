ONTraC (Ordered Niche Trajectory Construction) is a niche-centered, machine learning
method for constructing spatially continuous trajectories. ONTraC differs from existing tools in
that it treats a niche, rather than an individual cell, as the basic unit for spatial trajectory
analysis. In this context, we define niche as a multicellular, spatially localized region where
different cell types may coexist and interact with each other.  ONTraC seamlessly integrates
cell-type composition and spatial information by using the graph neural network modeling
framework. Its output, which is called the niche trajectory, can be viewed as a one dimensional
representation of the tissue microenvironment continuum. By disentangling cell-level and niche-
level properties, niche trajectory analysis provides a coherent framework to study coordinated
responses from all the cells in association with continuous tissue microenvironment variations.

## Installation

Please see the [installation tutorial](tutorials/installation.md)

## Tutorial

### Input File

A example input file is provided in `examples/stereo_seq_brain/original_data.csv`.
This file contains all input formation with five columns: Cell_ID, Sample, Cell_Type, x, and y.

| Cell_ID         | Sample   | Cell_Type | x       | y     |
| --------------- | -------- | --------- | ------- | ----- |
| E12_E1S3_100034 | E12_E1S3 | Fibro     | 15940   | 18584 |
| E12_E1S3_100035 | E12_E1S3 | Fibro     | 15942   | 18623 |
| ...             | ...      | ...       | ...     | ...   |
| E16_E2S7_326412 | E16_E2S7 | Fibro     | 32990.5 | 14475 |

For detailed information about input and output file, please see [IO files explanation](tutorials/IO_files.md#input-files).

### Running ONTraC

The required options for running ONTraC are the paths to the input file and the three output directories:

- **preprocessing-dir:** This directory stores preprocessed data and other intermediary datasets for analysis.
- **GNN-dir:** This directory stores output from running the GP (Graph Pooling) algorithm.
- **NTScore-dir:** This directory stores NTScore output.

For detailed description about all parameters, please see [Parameters explanation](tutorials/parameters.md).

```{sh}
ONTraC -d simulated_dataset.csv --preprocessing-dir simulation_preprocessing_dir --GNN-dir simulation_GNN --NTScore-dir simulation_NTScore --hidden-feats 4 -k 6 --modularity-loss-weight 1 --purity-loss-weight 30 --regularization-loss-weight 0.1 --beta 0.03 2>&1 | tee simulation.log
```

The input dataset and output files could be downloaded from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/11186620).

We recommand running `ONTraC` on GPU, it may take much more time on your own laptop with CPU only.

### Output

The intermediate and final results are located in `preprocessing-dir`, `GNN-dir`, and `NTScore-dir` directories. Please see [IO files explanation](tutorials/IO_files.md#output-files) for detailed infromation.

### Visualization

Please see [post analysis tutorial](tutorials/post_analysis.md).
